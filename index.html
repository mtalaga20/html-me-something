				<p>Brother and sister Michael and Lauren Talaga faced 
				language barriers on a foreign train heading West for Austria and were left
				abandoned by their family on their vacation to Europe. Even worse,
				they got on the wrong train and had no money for tickets!
				Would they be arrested? Kicked off the one way train? </p>

				<p>They boarded the train with their supposed tickets, which were actually for the
				next train. What happened next was any tourist's worst nightmare!
				A grumpy train conductor who spoke no English demanded tickets!
				"Ticket," she yelled, as her frustration grew increasingly as they
				struggled to come up with a solution. 30 minutes had passed, 
				and the conductors started to swarm the siblings and were speaking with
				each other.</p>

				<p>"I speak English," said one of her co-workers. "That'll be 
				&euro;200." How did they get out of that hole without any money?
				Luckily, the broke college kid was saved by the bell from a venmo
				transfer from his mother.
